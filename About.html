        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            I am currently pursuing a degree in psychology, where I am gaining a comprehensive understanding of human behavior and the factors that influence mental health and well-being. Alongside my psychology studies, I am also taking courses in web design. By combining these fields, my goal is to develop innovative digital platforms that provide accessible, user-friendly tools for promoting emotional wellness and offering psychological resources to a broader audience.

            I thrive in environments that encourage creativity, adaptability, and open communication. I value inclusivity and clarity in all interactions, as these qualities foster spaces where everyone feels supported and heard. Whether conducting research or collaborating on group projects, I approach every challenge with thoughtfulness, focus, and a commitment to delivering impactful results. Throughout my journey, I have cultivated a strong dedication to both personal and professional growth. I believe in the importance of balancing hard work with self-care and continuously seek opportunities to make meaningful contributions to the communities I engage with. Whether advancing the understanding of mental health or leveraging technology to create positive change, I am passionate about making a difference.
